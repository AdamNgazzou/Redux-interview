## Project Overview

This Product Showcase is a responsive web application built with Next.js and Redux that allows users to browse, filter, and interact with a collection of products. The application demonstrates modern frontend development practices, state management, responsive design, and performance optimization techniques.

The project solves the common e-commerce challenge of presenting products in an engaging, interactive way while providing intuitive filtering and navigation capabilities. It showcases how to build a performant, SEO-friendly application with a focus on user experience across all devices.

## SEO Optimization

The application implements several SEO best practices:

- **Metadata Management**: Uses `next-seo` to configure comprehensive metadata including title templates, descriptions, and Open Graph data
- **Structured Data**: Implements JSON-LD for organization information to enhance search engine understanding
- **Canonical URLs**: Sets proper canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues
- **Meta Tags**: Includes appropriate meta tags for viewport, description, and keywords
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses semantic HTML elements throughout the application for better accessibility and SEO
- **Mobile Optimization**: Fully responsive design ensures good mobile SEO rankings
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast loading times contribute to better SEO rankings

## Page Routing

The application uses Next.js's file-based routing system:

- `/` - Home page with a simple counter component (demonstration of basic Redux)
- `/products` - Main product showcase page with filtering and pagination
- Future routes can be easily added by creating new files in the `pages` directory

The routing structure is designed to be scalable, allowing for easy addition of new sections like product details, categories, or user accounts.
